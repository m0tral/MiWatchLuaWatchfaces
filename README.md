### Xiaomi watchfaces examples running on LUA engine, Mi Band 8 Pro, Mi Watch S3 models  

Samples for various Xiaomi models of LUA watchfaces.  
you can read more about LUA - https://www.lua.org/start.html  

Easyface can pack it - https://github.com/m0tral/Easyface  

These models are running on NuttX => https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/   
and use most popular graphic library LVGL => https://lvgl.io/get-started

For images I use lvgl build-in converter => https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter  
  
<img src="img/lvgl_conv_settings.png"/>   
Here is shown which params to set   
   
It's possible to debug all this stuff on PC cross-platform emulator,   
I personally prefer use Windows 10, under WSl2/Ubuntu subsystem.   
Will show you later how to do it.
