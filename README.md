# MiWatchLuaWatchfaces
  
### Xiaomi watchfaces examples running on LUA engine, Mi Band 8 Pro, Mi Watch S3 models  

Samples for various Xiami models of LUA watchfaces.  
you can read more about LUA - https://www.lua.org/start.html  

Easyface can pack it - https://github.com/m0tral/Easyface  

These models are running on NuttX => https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/
and use most popular graphic library LVGL => https://lvgl.io/get-started

For images I use lvgl build-in converter => https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter
I'll describe later which params to use

going to update during watch/watchfaces develop process
